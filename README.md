# COMMUNITY SCIENCE MUSEUM

![Community Science Museum Image](images/csm.png)

The semester project was to make a working website for a new local community science museum. Target audience was middle school children and their families.

## Description

The Community Science Museum site was created based on a brief with a given target audience. The code was built using only HTML and CSS.

When given the semester project we were given a brief and a folder containing all dummy text and images to be used for the museum website. I created a logo based on the theme and by using an image from the folder.

After the logo was created a process started with making a design that would attract both middle school children and their families. The design was made so the parents would want to bring their children to the museum because it seems like the best family activity; where you can have fun, but also learn exciting things.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank everyone who has patiently helped me truly understand what is behind the code, and I would like to thank everyone who has helped by testing my live sites to find the hidden faults.

In this spesific project I would like to send a big thank you to the introduction of grid etc to push the footer further down when working on bigger screens.
